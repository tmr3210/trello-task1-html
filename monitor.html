   <p> A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the <br>
    video and graphics information generated by a connected computer <br>
     through the computer's video card. Monitors are similar to TVs <br>
     but usually display information at a much higher resolution. <br>
     Also unlike televisions, monitors typically sit atop a desk <br>
      rather than being mounted on a wall. A monitor is sometimes <br>
       referred to as a screen, display, video display, video display <br>
       terminal, video display unit, or video screen.</p>
